Course Objectives
When you finish this course, you will know what a relational database is, know what
SQL is, and know what you can do to the former with the latter. You will also know
why SQL is an important relational database language, and will actually be able to...

Query a relational database
The full range of SQL's query capabilities are explored in this course. Ample
exercises, with answers, are provided for each topic. By the time you're done, you will
be able to get information out of a relational database using SQL.
Maintain a relational database
You will also be able to put information into a relational database via SQL. You will
learn how to insert new data, update existing data, and delete obsolete data. You will
also understand how databases work in multi-user environments.
Define a relational database
Finally, you will know enough to actually create database objects with SQL, including,
tables, constraints, indices, and views. Database design, however, which is covered
in our other course offerings, is not addressed in this course.

What is a Relational Database?
A relational database is a collection of data stored in tables. Each table consists of
one or more vertical columns, and zero or more horizontal rows. Pictured below are
two tables from our exercise database, with three rows of sample data in each.
PERSONS
PERSON NAME BDATE GENDER COUNTRY JOB
1 Einstein 1879-03-20 Male Germany S
2 Dickens 1812-07-22 Male England W
3 Dickinson 1830-07-15 Female USA W
COUNTRIES
COUNTRY POP AREA GNP LANGUAGE LITERACY
Germany 81337541 137823 1331000 German 100
USA 263814032 3679192 6380000 English 95
England 58295119 94251 980200 English 99
Tables are identified by name
Table names must be unique within a database. Typical SQL databases allow up to
18 characters in a table name. The first character must be a letter, while the
remaining characters can be letters, numbers, or underscores.
Columns are identified by name
Column names are unique within each table, but the same column name can
appear in different tables. Both tables above, for example, have COUNTRY columns.
Rows are identified by their contents
The rows of a table do not have names, nor is their position in a table fixed.
Therefore, we refer to the rows of tables by describing the data values they contain:
'Person number 2,' for instance, or 'All English-speaking countries.'

What is SQL?
SQL is the most popular of all database languages. The name is an acronym for
Structured Query Language, though SQL is much more than just a query language.
Some pronounce the name as three separate letters, S-Q-L, but most say, 'sequel.'
STRUCTURED

LANGUAGE
Developed by IBM
Originally developed in 1974 by D. D. Chamberlin and others at IBM's San Jose
Research Laboratory, SQL was finally released to the public as an integral part of
IBM's SQL/DS and DB2 database products in 1982-1983.
Accepted by the world
SQL was adopted as an official standard by the American National Standards
Institute (ANSI) in 1986, and in 1987 by the International Organization for
Standardization (ISO). It is currently available in over 100 commercial products.
Implemented in many different ways
In spite of its popularity and its acceptance as an official standard, the SQL language
is rather poorly defined and suffers from a number of internal inconsistencies. The
result is a variety of SQL 'dialects' that differ slightly, but annoyingly, one from another.
5
What is SQL? continued
The
It
 basic SQL language is actually quite small, and relatively easy to learn and use.
consists of six basic statement types (select, insert, update, delete, create, and
drop) that can be conveniently grouped into the three categories shown below.
SQL STATEMENTS BY CATEGORY
CATEGORY STATEMENT PURPOSE
Query SELECТ
Maintenance INSERT
UPDATE
Display rows of one or more tables
Add rows to a table
Change rows in a table
DELETE Remove rows from a table
Definition CREATE Add tables, indices, views
DROP Remove tables, indices, views
Query statements
The SELECT statement, which has many different forms, is used to formulate all
queries. SELECT statements 'ask questions' whose answers may be found in, or
derived from, one or more of the tables in a database.
Maintenance statements
The INSERT statement, which has two different forms, is used to add new rows to a
table (one or more at a time). The UPDATE statement is used to modify existing
rows, while the DELETE statement is used to remove obsolete rows.
Definition statements
The CREATE statement, which also has several different forms, is used to define
new tables, indices, and views in a database. Various forms of the DROP statement
are used to remove these components when they are no longer required.
6
What is SQL? continued
A SQL statement is a collection of clauses, keywords, and parameters that perform a
particular function. In the examples below, each clause is shown on a separate line;
keywords appear in all uppercase letters, parameters in all lowercase letters.
QUERY STMT
SELECT columns
FROM table
WHERE comparisons
MAINTENANCE STMT DEFINITION STMT
DELETE
FROM table
WHERE comparisons
CREATE
INDEX index
ON table (columns)
Clauses
The various clauses of SQL statements are named after their initial words: the
SELECT clause, for example, or the FROM clause. SQL allows multiple clauses per
line, but most SQL programmers use separate lines for clarity and ease of editing.
Keywords
SQL reserves a small number of words, called keywords, for specific purposes.
Keywords can be entered in upper, lower, or mixed-case letters; they are shown here
in all uppercase. Keywords may not be used as table or column names.
Parameters
Parameters are the 'variable' parts of each clause. When formulating a SQL
statement, you insert the appropriate column names, table names, and other such
values in place of the lowercase parameters shown above.

8
Selecting All Columns & Rows
The simplest kind of query displays all the columns and all the rows of a single
table. An asterisk is entered in the SELECT clause (to indicate that all columns
should be included), and the table name is specified in the FROM clause, like so:
SQL STATEMENT JOB TITLE
S Scientist
SELECT *
FROM JOBS
E Entertainer
W Writer
Instructor
SQL STATEMENT COUNTRY RELIGION PERCENT
Germany Protestant 45
SELECT*
FROM RELIGIONS
Germany Catholic 37
England Catholic 30
England Anglican 70
All queries have SELECT and FROM clauses
The FROM clause follows the SELECT clause
The asterisk (* ) means 'all columns'
The table name is specified in the FROM clause
Columns and rows appear in arbitrary order

Selecting All Columns & Rows continued
The general syntax of a SQL SELECT statement appears below. Keywords and
examples are shown in uppercase letters, while parameters appear in lowercase.

Exercises
1. Ask the instructor for a brief tutorial in the use of the classroom database.
2. Select all the columns and all the rows of the PERSONS table.
3. Explore the COUNTRIES table using a SELECT statement.
4. Take a look at the ERRORS table.
5. Inspect the ARMIES table.
Extra Credit
6. Most self-respecting databases have a table called SYSCOLUMNS. Take a peek.
7. Choose any other table from the SYSCOLUMNS table and display it.
10
Selecting Specific Columns
To select specific columns, we enter a list of columns in the SELECT statement
(instead of an asterisk). Each column name is separated from the others by
comma and optional spaces. The columns are displayed in the order listed.

Selecting Specific Columns continued
The revised syntax of a SQL SELECT statement appears below. Note that it has
been expanded to include the column list parameter in the SELECT clause.
SYNTAX SUMMARY
CLAUSE PARAMETERS EXAMPLE
SELECT

Exercises
1. Select only the JOB column from the JOBS table.
2. Show the NAME and BDATE columns from the PERSONS table.
3. The RELIGIONS table contains three columns - COUNTRY, RELIGION, and
PERCENT. Display all of these columns, but show them in reverse order.
Extra Credit
4. Show all the columns of the COUNTRIES table, but put the COUNTRY column on
both ends (so we can line 'em up with a ruler). Do this first without using an
asterisk, then do it again with one.
12
Selecting Specific Rows
Rows in a table are identified by the values they contain. It is therefore important to
understand the different categories of values that SQL supports, and the appropriate
syntax for entering each kind of value in query statements.
VALUE SUMMARY
CATEGORY DESCRIPTION EXAMPLES
NUMERIC positive values 3, +12
negative values -7, -1024000
decimal values 3.141519, -.96
NONNUMERIC single words 'Chamberlin', 'SELEСТ multiple words
single quotes
DATE 'yyyy-mm-dd' format
'We love SQL', 'The LORD is good to me'
'10 O"Clock', 'I don"t know'
'1996-01-01', '1996-12-31'
Numeric values are entered in the normal way
Numeric values are specified in queries as one or more of the following characters:
+-0123456789.
The sign is optional, but must appear first. Only one decimal point is allowed. Note
that commas, dollar signs, and percent signs are not allowed in numeric values.
Non-numeric values are enclosed in quotes
Non-numeric values, called strings, are entered inside of single quote marks. Use
two consecutive single quote marks inside a string to representasingle quote.
Date values are entered in 'yyyy-mm-dd' format
While the SQL standard lacks a uniform representation of dates, the format shown
above is supported in most SQL dialects. Dates must be enclosed in single quotes.
13
Selecting Specific Rows continued
A comparison is a phrase that consists of a column name, a comparison operator,
and a value. All comparisons yield a result of either true or false. Comparisons are
used to specify which rows of a table should be included in the result of a query.
COMPARISON OPERATORS
OPERATOR MEANING
=
<>
<
<=
>
>=
Equal to
Not equal to
Less than
Less than or equal to
Greater than
Greater than or equal to
EXAMPLE
NAME= 'EINSTEIN'
BDATE <> '1944-05-02'
POP < 100000
NAME<= 'O"Grady'
AREA> 999
BDATE >= '1962-06-19'
A column name is specified on the left
The column name can be entered in upper, lower, or mixed-case letters. In this text,
columns names are shown in uppercase. Note that even though column names are
non-numeric, they are not enclosed in quotes.
Avalue is specified on the right
Values must be entered appropriately for their value type - that is, numbers as they
would normally be written, strings in single quotes, and dates in the 'yyyy-mm-dd'
format. Values should be of the same type as columns to which they are compared.
An operator is specified in the middle
Comparison operators are placed between column names and values. Spaces on
either side of a comparison operator are allowed, but are not required. However,
spaces are not allowed between symbols in multiple symbol operators ( <>, <=, >= ).
14
Selecting Specific Rows continued
Comparisons are specified in the WHERE clause of a SQL SELECT statement. The
WHERE clause must immediately follow the FROM clause. The result table includes
all the rows of the source table where the comparison is true.
